# 8 Tips for a Great Hackathon
1. Set up your work environment - with all the tools you need (technologically and personally)
2. Go with you gut - do what you want to do and believe in yourself
3. Care about your team - make sure you all know what your role is, communicate
4. Visualize - bring a notebook and some pens, work on your UI (get to know design frameworks and libraries)
5. Eat and sleep - don't lose yourself in the work, take some breaks, take care of yourself
6. POC - don't fixate on making your product as "right" as it could be, make a POC
7. Goals - know your goals ahead of time, let them guide you
8. Have fun!
